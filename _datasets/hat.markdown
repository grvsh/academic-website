The official HAT dataset page is <a href="https://jurie.users.greyc.fr/datasets/hat.html">here</a>.
It was made when I was with GREYC CNRS UMR 6072, Univesity of Caen Normandie.

HAT contains 9344 human images labelled with 27 semantic attributes. The images were crawled from
Flickr and were manually annotated by three annotators for each attribute.
