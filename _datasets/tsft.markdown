TSFT dataset contains 589 * manually annotated face tubes of 94 subjects  in popular TV series. The
dataset has diverse set of subjects (age, gender, race, sex) in challening filming conditions (home,
office, bar, inside car, day, night etc.). The average tube length is 55 frames and the average face
size is 121 pixels square.

It is a highly challenging dataset as more than 32000 faces appear in many different filming
conditions and unrestricted emotions. To demonstrate the challenge qualitatively the following
figure shows the false positive matches found by our method (ref. below):
