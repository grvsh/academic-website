NEC Drone dataset was created to study the problems of human action classification and domain 
adaptation in videos. The main webpage for the dataset is <a
href="http://www.nec-labs.com/~mas/NEC-Drone/">hosted by NEC Labs</a>. Kindly follow the
instructions there to obtain a copy.

Please cite the following paper if you use the NEC-Drones dataset.
